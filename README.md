<h3>My name is Liya Hagos, a student at YearUp taking the Quality assurance track.</h3>
Prior to joining this program, I used to work as home health aide however I always had 
interest for IT, and I was exploring different bootcamp options before signing up for 
Year Up. I took some online courses like SQL and SharePoint to get myself familiarize 
with IT. My goal is to finish my program and get into big tech companies so
I can branch out to more IT fields.
